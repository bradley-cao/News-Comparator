        "article": "A sailor looks at the Russian missile cruiser Moskva moored in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine 10, 2013. REUTERS/Stringer April 15 (Reuters) - Russia has confirmed the Moskva missile cruiser, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, has sunk while being towed to port following what it said was a fire and explosions involving ammunition stowed onboard. Ukraine says the Moskva's fate was sealed by a missile strike launched by its forces from the coast which ripped open the hulking Soviet-era ship's hull. Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events. Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions. Here's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness: WHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF? Russia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss degrades the fleet's air defences, particularly on longer range missions. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW? The ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet. WILL IT LOSS CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE UKRAINE CONFLICT? Unlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role. One U.S. official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy. WILL RUSSIA'S NAVY NOW CHANGE THE WAY IT OPERATES AND DOES THAT MATTER? Yes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which U.S. officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But U.S. officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military\u2019s ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection. WAS THE MOSKVA EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT? Not clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere. CAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES No. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war. WAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS? No. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles. HOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT? Not very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated. HOW BIG A BLOW TO RUSSIAN MILITARY PRIDE IS THE SINKING? It's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour. The sinking, whether by Ukrainian missile strikes or through a mishap, \u201cis a major propaganda victory for Ukraine,\u201d said an assessment by the ISW. Western diplomats and experts expect senior officers in the Black Sea Fleet to lose their jobs over the sinking. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

        "article": "Russian strikes pounded a military factory near Kyiv that makes the missiles Ukraine claims it used to sink the Moskva naval flagship, with Moscow on Friday vowing renewed attacks on the capital. A workshop and an administrative building at the Vizar plant, which lies near Kyiv's international Zhuliany airport, were seriously damaged in the overnight strikes, an AFP journalist saw.\u00a0 Russia had earlier announced it had used Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles to hit the factory, which Ukraine's state weapons manufacturer Ukroboronprom says produced Neptune missiles. \"There were five hits. My employee was in the office and got thrown off his feet by the blast,\" Andrei Sizov, a 47-year-old owner of a nearby wood workshop, told AFP. \"They are making us pay for destroying the Moskva,\" he said. It was the first major Russian strike around the Ukrainian capital in over two weeks. The Kyiv regional governor said there were at least two other Russian strikes on Friday, without providing details on damage or casualties. Oleksandr Pavliuk said civilians thinking about returning to the capital should \"wait for quieter times.\" The governor of Ukraine's southern Odessa region, Maxim Marchenko, said the 186-meter-long Russian missile cruiser was hit by Ukrainian Neptune missiles on Wednesday.\u00a0 The Moskva had been leading Russia's naval effort in the seven-week conflict, and the circumstances around its sinking and the fate of its crew of over 500 remain murky. Russia's Defense Ministry said a blast on the vessel was the result of exploding ammunition and that the resulting damage had caused it to \"lose its balance\" as it was being towed to port on Thursday. Natalia Gumeniuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said that Russia would seek revenge for the sinking and that bad weather had meant the Moskva's crew could not be evacuated. \"We saw that other ships tried to assist it, but even the forces of nature were on Ukraine's side because the storm made both the rescue operation and crew evacuations impossible,\" Gumeniuk said in a briefing. The fleet has been blockading the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, where Russian officials say they are in full control although Ukrainian fighters are still holed up in the city's fortress-like steelworks. Moscow, which invaded Ukraine partly because of deepening ties between Kyiv and NATO, on Friday warned of unspecified \"consequences\" should Finland and Sweden join the U.S.-led defense alliance. The two countries are considering joining NATO after Russia's devastating invasion of neighboring Ukraine. \"They will automatically find themselves on the NATO frontline,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Shortly afterwards, Finland's European Affairs Minister Tytti Tuppurainen said it was \"highly likely\" that her country would apply for NATO membership. \"The people of Finland, they seem to have already made up their mind and there is a huge majority for the NATO membership,\" she told Britain's Sky News. Unlike Sweden, Finland neighbors Russia, from which it declared independence in 1917 after 150 years of Russian rule. Russia on Friday said it was expelling 18 members of the European Union mission after the bloc kicked out some of Moscow's representatives for spying. The EU condemned the \"unjustified\" move, saying in a statement that \"Russia's chosen course of action will further deepen its international isolation.\" Russian forces last month started withdrawing from around the Ukrainian capital as they were redeployed to focus on territory in the east of the country, but the city remains vulnerable to missile strikes. \"The number and scale of missile strikes against targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or sabotage committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime on Russian territory,\" Russia's Defense Ministry said.\u00a0 \"As a result of the strike on the Zhulyansky machine-building plant 'Vizar,' the workshops for the production and repair of long-range and medium-range anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as anti-ship missiles, were destroyed,\" the ministry said.\u00a0 Seizing the eastern Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists control the Donetsk and Lugansk areas, would allow Moscow to create a southern corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula. Ukraine said that Russian strikes had killed five people in the area, after President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow's forces were aiming to \"destroy\" the region. A Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians from the war-torn east killed seven people and wounded more than two dozen, Ukraine said on Friday. Ukrainian authorities have been urging people in the south and the Donbas area in the east to quickly move west in advance of a large-scale Russian offensive. Mariupol is in ruins 50 days into Russia's so-called \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died in the strategic city, many of their bodies still trapped in apartment buildings. Mariupol's residents have started coming outside in search of food, water and an escape route. The UN's World Food Program appealed for access to Ukrainians trapped in war zones including Mariupol, saying those besieged were starving to death.\u00a0 \"It's one thing when people are suffering from the devastation of war. It's another thing when they're being starved to death,\" WFP Executive Director David Beasley said in a statement. In Geneva, the UN refugee agency said that more than 5 million people have now fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, in Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II. Moscow on Thursday accused Ukraine of sending helicopters to bomb a village in Russia's Bryansk region -- not far from the border with Ukraine \u2014 injuring eight people.\u00a0 Kyiv has denied the helicopter attack, instead accusing Russia of staging the incidents to stir up \"anti-Ukrainian hysteria\" in the country. Separately, the Russian Defense Ministry said Friday its strategic rocket forces \"eliminated up to 30 Polish mercenaries\" in a strike on the village of Izyumskoe, not far from the city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine.\u00a0 In Kharkiv itself, Russian strikes killed at least seven, including a child, the region's governor said Friday, as Moscow's forces stepped up attacks. \n            At least 10 independent media outlets have been blocked or closed down over their coverage of the war in Ukraine.\n             \n            The Moscow Times needs your help more than ever as we cover this devastating invasion and its sweeping impacts on Russian society.",
